# Borrow Book Monitoring System
An internal web utility system that monitors and tracks who borrowed which book.

## Prerequisites
- Apache
- MySQL Server
I recommend using XAMPP as it comes with built-in Apache for PHP and MySQL Server.

## Setup
1. Go to you XAMPP htdocs directory (usually in `C:\xampp\htdocs`, depending on where you installed your XAMPP)
2. Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/khianvictorycalderon/Borrow-Book-Monitoring-System.git`
3. Start Apache and MySQL from XAMPP control panel.
4. Go to your phpmyadmin panel and run this MySQL query:
    ```sql
    -- SQL Query here...
    ```
5. Go to your browser and run `localhost/Borrow-Book-Monitoring-System`
6. Enjoy!
